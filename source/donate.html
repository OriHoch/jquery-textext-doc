			<p>The TextExt plugin is completely free under the MIT license, however I do ask that you consider how long it took me to write the code, test and moreover this site and manual. If you like it and end up using it in your commercial project, I ask that you just buy me a beer (case or two maybe)</p>
			<p>The moneys that you donate go towards two very important causes:</p>
			<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
				<li>keeping me alive and</li>
				<li>supplying me with beer</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Having both, I will continue working on TextExt and <em>you get all future updates completely free</em>. If you donate a good coin, I will get pissed drunk on your behalf and maybe email you pictures of what that looked like! Does that sound awesome or what?</p>
